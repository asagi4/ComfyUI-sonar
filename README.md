# ComfyUI-sonar

Extremely WIP and untested implementation of Sonar sampling. Currently it may not be even close to working properly.

Only supports Euler and Euler Ancestral sampling.

## Description

See https://github.com/Kahsolt/stable-diffusion-webui-sonar for a more in-depth explanation.

Original implementation: https://github.com/Kahsolt/stable-diffusion-webui-sonar

My version basically just rips off this implementation for Diffusers: https://github.com/alexblattner/modified-euler-samplers-for-sonar-diffusers/
